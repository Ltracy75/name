6am, day after christmas
throws some clothes on in the dark
the smell of cold, car seat is freezing,
the world is sleeping, I am, done

up the stairs, to her appartment, she is bawled up on the couch, her mom and dad, went down to charlotte, they're not home to find us out, and we drive
now that I have found someone, I'm feeling more alone, than I ever have before,
she's a brick and I'm drowning slowly, off the coast and I'm heading nowhere,
she's a brick and I'm drowning slowly


they call her name at 730, i pace around the parking lot, I walk down to buy her flowers and sell some gifts that I got
can't you see, it's not me you're dying for and now she's feeling more alone, than she ever has, before, she's a brick and I'm drowning,
off the coast and I'm headed nowhwere, she's a brick and I'm drowning slowly

AS Weeks went by, it showed that she was not fine, they told me son, it's time to tell the truth and, she broke down, and I broke down, cause i was tired
of lying

driving back to her apartment, for the moment we're alone, and she's alone and I'm alone, and now i know it

she's a brick and I'm drowning slowly, off the coast and I'm heading nowhere,
she's a brick and I'm drowning slowly
